Hello-world first repositry

Hello everyone. I am new to Github, that is this is the first time I have really used it. So I decided to follow the tutorial. 
I want a carreer change into IT from Governmental Logisitcal work. Although I did work at Chrysler International Logistics for a short time period, I have always wanted to get into IT. I do have two degrees in IT, but yet to get my foot in the door into the field. This week I have several low level entry level positions I am interviewing for. Although the pay is quite low, I am willing to taking the job for experiance not the pay.
